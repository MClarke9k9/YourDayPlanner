# Work Day Planner
Introduction
As an myself employee with a busy schedule I wanted to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively, and this is the app I created to do just that.

# Code Samples
I created a daily planner to create a schedule

When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

When you scroll down your presented with time blocks for standard business hours, view the time blocks for that day.

Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, and when you click into a time block you can enter an event then click the save button for that time block.

The text for that event is saved in local storage, and when you refresh the page the saved events persist.
